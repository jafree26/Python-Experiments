# Python Experiments

This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of _DSCI 8133, Foundations of Data Science at Mississippi State University_.

## Plan

Future plans for this repository include adding data regarding workplace injuries and incidents to create meaningful changes and prevent incidents! I will also have a 
Jupyter notebook associated with this file [here](https://jupyter.org/)

In order to test the inclusion of a photograph, I've included a photo of a funny hedgehog that looks like me when I find a great dataset!
